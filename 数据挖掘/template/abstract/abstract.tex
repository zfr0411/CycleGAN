    Image style conversion refers to the conversion of image content from one domain to another.
    This tasks generally require paired pictures with the same con- tent in the both domains as training data. 
    Such as pix2pix[7], but this pair of training data is difficult to obtain. 
    The innovation of CycleGAN is that can migrate picture content from the source domain 
    to the target domain without paired training data. 
    The Generated Confrontation Network (GAN) consists of two subnetworks: a generator and a recognizer.
    The input to the generator is a random noise or condition vector 
    and the output is the target image. 
    The recognizer is a classifier, the input is an image, 
    and the output is whether the image is a real image. 
    In the training process, the generator and 
    the recognizer enhance their ability through continuous mutual game.
